## Introduction

This is a skills collection. I'm building practical skills to help with day-to-day work, and the repo will keep growing.

### ✨ Included Skills

#### 📝 Tutorial Writing Assistant

**Description**: Structured writing for a given domain or topic (tutorials, blogs, explainers). Use when you want to write a tech/domain article, explain a concept, or any piece that benefits from "think first, then write." Guides you to clarify goals and audience, use primary sources, and output clear, concise Markdown.

**Use Cases**:

* Need to write a technical tutorial or intro article
* Want to explain a concept or compare two things (e.g. "what's the difference between A and B")
* Ideas are unclear before writing; need to clarify goal and audience first
* Want output that is easy-to-grasp then deep, with runnable code examples

**Core Features**:

* 📋 Understand the domain and guide the author: clarify topic, target reader, focus, and length preferences
* 🔍 Gather sources: prefer official docs and authoritative sources; avoid unverifiable content
* ✍️ Write the tutorial: easy then deep, example before concept, one idea per paragraph, minimal Markdown
* 🎯 Guidelines: no repetition, one clear sentence for terms then expand if needed, runnable code blocks

**Trigger**:

```
Help me write a tutorial on XX
Write a blog post / explainer about XX
I want to write a tech article, help me clarify my thoughts first
/tutorial-writing
```

**Files**:

* 中文: [tutorial-writing-skill-zh.md](./tutorial-writing-skill-zh.md)
* English: [tutorial-writing-skill-en.md](./tutorial-writing-skill-en.md)
